## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (3.16.0 or higher)
- Dart SDK (3.0.0 or higher)
- iOS development environment (for iOS builds)
- TMDB API key

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd merl_cinema
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Configure API Key**
   - Get your TMDB API key from [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api)
   - Update `lib/core/constants/app_constants.dart`:
   ```dart
   static const String apiKey = 'YOUR_TMDB_API_KEY';
   ```

4. **Run the app**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## iOS Setup

### Prerequisites for iOS Development

1. **Xcode** (latest version recommended)
2. **iOS Simulator** or physical iOS device
3. **Apple Developer Account** (for device testing and App Store distribution)

### iOS Configuration

The app is already configured for iOS with:
- Minimum iOS version: 12.0
- Proper Info.plist with required permissions
- App icons and launch screen
- Xcode project configuration

### Running on iOS

1. **Open iOS Simulator**
   ```bash
   open -a Simulator
   ```

2. **Run on iOS**
   ```bash
   flutter run -d ios
   ```

## GitHub Actions Workflow

The repository includes a comprehensive GitHub Actions workflow for building IPA files:

### Workflow Features

- **Automated builds** on push to main/develop branches
- **Code analysis** and testing
- **iOS app building** (both debug and release)
- **IPA generation** with proper signing
- **Artifact upload** for easy distribution

### Setup for Automated Builds

1. **Repository Secrets**
   Add the following secrets to your GitHub repository:

   ```
   BUILD_CERTIFICATE_BASE64    # Base64 encoded .p12 certificate
   P12_PASSWORD               # Password for the .p12 certificate
   KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD          # Password for the keychain
   PROVISIONING_PROFILE_BASE64 # Base64 encoded provisioning profile
   PROVISIONING_PROFILE_SPECIFIER # Provisioning profile specifier
   CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY         # Code signing identity
   DEVELOPMENT_TEAM           # Apple Developer Team ID
   ```

2. **Update ExportOptions.plist**
   - Replace `YOUR_TEAM_ID` with your actual Apple Developer Team ID
   - Adjust export options as needed

3. **Workflow Triggers**
   - The workflow runs automatically on pushes to `main` and `develop` branches
   - Manual triggers are also available via GitHub Actions UI

### Building IPA Files

The workflow creates two types of builds:

1. **Unsigned Build** (for testing)
   - Runs on all branches
   - Creates unsigned IPA files
   - Good for internal testing

2. **Signed Build** (for distribution)
   - Runs only on `main` branch
   - Requires proper certificates and provisioning profiles
   - Creates signed IPA files ready for TestFlight/App Store
